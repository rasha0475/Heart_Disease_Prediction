# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction** system built using **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal of this project is to predict whether an individual has a **healthy heart** or is at risk of having a **defective heart** based on various health-related attributes. The model is trained using **Logistic Regression** and evaluated for its accuracy and performance.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart disease can significantly improve health outcomes. This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a person has a **healthy heart (0)** or a **defective heart (1)** based on the following health metrics:

* **Age**
* **Sex**
* **Chest pain type**
* **Resting blood pressure**
* **Serum cholesterol**
* **Fasting blood sugar**
* **Resting electrocardiographic results**
* **Maximum heart rate achieved**
* **Exercise induced angina**
* **Oldpeak**
* **Slope of peak exercise ST segment**
* **Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy**
* **Thalassemia**

The model uses **Logistic Regression** to classify the target variable (Heart Disease) and is evaluated on its accuracy using both **training** and **test** datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

* **Python**: Programming language used for building the model.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For visualizing the data and results.
* **Google Colab**: For coding, training the model, and running experiments in a cloud-based environment.

## üîç **Features of the Project**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   The data is loaded from a CSV file and is preprocessed to handle missing values, scaling, and feature extraction.

2. **Model Building**:
   A **Logistic Regression** model is trained on the dataset. The model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on various features.

3. **Evaluation**:
   The model is evaluated using accuracy scores on both **training** and **test** datasets.

4. **Predictive System**:
   A system is built to input a set of health metrics and predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

## üìë **Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the necessary Python libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run on Google Colab**
   Since this project was developed using **Google Colab**, you can open the notebook directly on Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/heart-disease-prediction/blob/main/heart_disease_model.ipynb).

4. **Input Data for Prediction**
   The model is ready to predict heart disease risk based on input features. You can modify the input data in the notebook and run the prediction.

## üîë **How to Use the Model**

To make a prediction using the trained model, provide the following input values in the correct order:

1. **Age**
2. **Sex (1 = male, 0 = female)**
3. **Chest pain type (1, 2, 3, or 4)**
4. **Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)**
5. **Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)**
6. **Fasting blood sugar (1 if > 120 mg/dl, 0 otherwise)**
7. **Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, or 2)**
8. **Maximum heart rate achieved**
9. **Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)**
10. **Oldpeak (depression induced by exercise relative to rest)**
11. **Slope of peak exercise ST segment (1, 2, or 3)**
12. **Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy**
13. **Thalassemia (1, 2, or 3)**

Example:

```python
input_data = (63, 1, 3, 145, 233, 1, 0, 150, 0, 2.3, 0, 0, 1)
prediction = model.predict(input_data_reshaped)
print(prediction)
```

## üìä **Evaluation Metrics**

The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy scores on both training and test data:

* **Accuracy on Training Data**: \~85%
* **Accuracy on Test Data**: \~82%

These results show that the model can generalize well to unseen data, making it a reliable predictor for heart disease.

## üå± **Future Improvements**

* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model's parameters for improved performance.
* **Model Optimization**: Experimenting with other classification algorithms like **Random Forest** or **SVM**.
* **Deployment**: Deploy the model as an API for real-time predictions using frameworks like **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
